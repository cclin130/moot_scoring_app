-------------------------scores_TEMPLATE.csv------------------------
In this csv, we will have an entry per competitor, per round, per judge.
For example, given a room that has four competitors and four judges in a certain round,
that round will have 16 entries in the scores csv (4 judges x 4 oralists = 16).

For each row, input a competitor's ID, the ID of a judge that evaluated the competitor,
and the score that judge gave. If you have k rounds, and each round has j judges,
you will have k x j rows for each unique competitor.

-------------------------teams_TEMPLATE.csv-------------------------
In this csv, we will have one entry per competitor. The competitor's accompanying information,
such as teamID, competitorID, name, and school will be included in that competitor's
respective row.
